  <title>Random Test Order - Allows you to run your tests in a random order</title>
  <description>
        Allows you to run your unit, integration, and functional tests in a random order.
        This is helpful when trying to identify tests that rely on data or setup from another test.

        {code}grails random-test-order [test type] [rerun]{code}

        [test type]
            -unit
            -integration
            -functional
        [rerun]
            -rerun

        examples:
            grails random-test-order -unit             //will run all unit tests in a random order
            grails random-test-order -unit -rerun      //will rerun all unit tests in the previous random order


        When you execute the script you will see output like the following:

        About to execute the following test app script...
        grails test-app -unit UnitBTests UnitCTests UnitATests

        This will allow you to copy/paste the outputted command in order to re-run your tests in the same order
        that they previously occurred on another machine.
